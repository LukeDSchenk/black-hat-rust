# black-hat-rust

Translating Justin Seitz's "Black Hat Python" into Rust for shits and giggles. I will try and keep the code examples very similar so as to help readers of the book translate the code. That being said, I have also been learning about systems programming lately, and how you should error check all system calls.
Basically I will try not to add more functionality for the sake of translation but I might throw in a little TLC if you get what I am saying.
